## 🚀 Quick Start

### ⚡ Easiest: One-Click Demo (No MongoDB needed)
```bash
# Just double-click START_DEMO.bat
# OR run manually:
cd backend && npm install && node mock-server.js
# In another terminal:
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```
Open **http://localhost:5173** → Login with `admin@fundtrace.ai` / `FundTrace@2024`

### Full Stack (with MongoDB)

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+, Python 3.10+, MongoDB Atlas account

#### 1. Configure Backend
```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your MONGO_URI
npm install && npm start
```

#### 2. Start Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install && npm run dev
```

#### 3. ML Service (Optional)
```bash
cd ml-service
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000
```

## 🎯 Fraud Detection Capabilities

| Fraud Type | Detection Method | Severity |
|------------|-----------------|---------|
| Structuring | Rule: multiple txs near ₹50k threshold | HIGH |
| Layering | BFS graph traversal ≥4 hops | CRITICAL |
| Round-Tripping | Cycle detection in graph | CRITICAL |
| Dormant Activation | Account inactive >90 days + large inflow | CRITICAL |
| Fan-Out | 5+ unique receivers in 30 min | HIGH |
| Mule Behaviour | Out/In ratio >90%, balance retention <5% | HIGH |
| High Velocity | 10+ transactions in 30 min | MEDIUM |
| Anomaly (ML) | Isolation Forest score | VARIABLE |

## 📊 Demo Story (For Judges)

1. **Login** → Dashboard shows live transaction stream
2. **Simulator triggers layering** → Funds flow through shell chain
3. **Alert fires** → "Layering chain detected — CRITICAL"
4. **Open Graph** → Animated red path shows laundering route
5. **Create Case** → Investigation workspace opens
6. **Add notes** → Document investigation findings
7. **Generate STR** → PDF report downloads instantly

## 💬 Judge Q&A

**"Why Isolation Forest?"**
Banking fraud is highly imbalanced. Isolation Forest works well for unsupervised anomaly detection where labelled fraud data is limited.

**"Why MongoDB over Neo4j?"**
MongoDB Atlas enabled faster hackathon prototyping with graph-like aggregation pipelines. Production roadmap includes Neo4j for heavy graph workloads.

**"Where is the AI?"**
The intelligence layer combines graph heuristics with anomaly scoring. The model evaluates transaction behaviour, velocity, account relationships, and suspicious graph structures continuously.
